# Gas Price Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
Gas Price Analysis project use Python, ETL, Web Scaping, and Machine Learning Model to explore the future Gas Price in the U.S . We perform price forcasting and prediction to visualize our findings based on the gas consumption, supply, and gas types in the last two decades. Our goal is to provide users to predict the future gas price in U.S. by interacting with different Machine Learning Model.
### Datasets
- U.S Natural Gas Imports Price vs. Exports Price
- U.S Natural Gas Total Imports vs. Exports
- U.S Natural Market Gas Production
- U.S Natural Gas Total Consumption
- U.S Natural Gas in Storage from Underground
