# Gas Price Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
Gas Price Analysis project use Python, ETL, Web Scaping, and Machine Learning Model to explore the future Gas Price in the U.S . We perform price forcasting and prediction to visualize our findings based on the gas consumption, supply, and gas types in the last two decades. Our goal is to provide users to predict the future gas price in U.S. by interacting with different Machine Learning Model.

## Presentation
- Topic: Gas Price Prediction and Analysis
- Reason: After a pandemic, people are planning to going back to work. Drivers bemoan high gasoline prices. Besides, gas price rising impacts not only on daily life and travel, but also on various trades and industries.Through analyzing the historical natural gas datasets from U.S., we provide a platform for people explore more about the changes of natural gas price and use machine learning model to help them predict accurate gas price in the future.  
- Description of the source of data
- Questions hope to answer with the data
  - What is the average natural gas price now and future.
  - How the natural gas price changed from the last decades.
  - Which machine learning model can help us to predict the gas price.
  - Make a better decision on energy using and planning in the future.
